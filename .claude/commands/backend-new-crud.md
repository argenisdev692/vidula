description: Generates a simple Laravel 13 / PHP 8.5 CRUD module for standard entities without enterprise overengineering. 5-line summary.

# BACKEND NEW SIMPLE CRUD AGENT — PHP 8.5 + Laravel 13

## PHASE 0 — QUALIFY THE REQUEST

Before writing any code, you MUST:

1. Read `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md`
2. Read `.claude/skills/ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL-SIMPLE-CRUD.md`
3. Read `.claude/OWASP/SKILL.md` — the always-on security baseline (15+1 items mapped to OWASP Top 10:**2025** + API Top 10:2023 + LLM Top 10:2025 when AI is in scope)
4. Call context7 to resolve current docs for: Laravel 13, Spatie Laravel Data 4.x, Spatie Permission 7.x, Spatie Activitylog, Pest 4
5. Call tavily to verify the latest stable versions of all packages you will touch, prioritizing recent/current sources (`time_range: day`, `week`, or `month`) and official docs; avoid historical years unless the task explicitly asks for them

Only continue if the requested module qualifies as a simple CRUD:

- One aggregate / one main entity
- Around 3 to 8 persisted fields
- Standard CRUD + restore
- `bulk delete` + `bulk restore` are allowed when the table UI needs batch selection — they are always shipped together (a delete-only bulk action is a UX dead-end)
- No files/media, exports, queues, WebSockets, external integrations, or complex cross-module orchestration unless explicitly requested
- No rich workflow/state machine that would justify the intermediate architecture

If the request does NOT qualify, STOP and instruct the user to use `/backend-new` instead.

## PHASE 1 — PLAN (produce checklist)

Before generating files, produce a checklist and mark each item as:

- ✅ DONE
- ❌ SKIPPED (with reason)
- ⚠️ WARN

### Required Checklist

**PHP 8.5 — simple CRUD is NOT exempt (see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5.1)**

- [ ] `declare(strict_types=1)` in every `.php` file
- [ ] Explicit return type on every method
- [ ] `final readonly class` on every stateless DI class (Handlers, Controllers, VOs, Adapters)
- [ ] Constructor property promotion on every injected dependency
- [ ] Pipe `|>` in normalization chains (trim → strtolower → validate); `match` over chained `if/elseif`; `clone($obj, [...])` for wither methods
- [ ] `#[\NoDiscard]` on Command Handlers that return UUIDs / result objects callers must consume
- [ ] `casts()` **method** on the Eloquent model (NEVER the legacy `$casts` array)
- [ ] `FILTER_THROW_ON_FAILURE` inside Value Objects using `filter_var()`
- [ ] Do NOT force `|>` / `clone(...)` / `#[\NoDiscard]` artificially when a file genuinely does not benefit (e.g., a 1-line getter)

**Architecture (`.claude/skills/ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL-SIMPLE-CRUD.md`)**

- [ ] Module lives in `src/Modules/{Name}/` with `Domain / Application / Infrastructure`
- [ ] Application folders stay flat: `DTOs`, `Commands`, `Queries`
- [ ] Domain imports nothing from Laravel or Infrastructure
- [ ] Domain contains the entity, ID Value Object, and repository port
- [ ] Additional Value Objects are created only for fields with real invariants
- [ ] DTOs extend `Spatie\LaravelData\Data` and are NOT `readonly`
- [ ] Mapper is the ONLY contact point between Domain and Eloquent
- [ ] One repository port + one Eloquent repository implementation
- [ ] Controllers stay thin
- [ ] ServiceProvider is registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`
- [ ] `bulk delete` AND `bulk restore` ship together when the UI exposes batch selection — each uses its own request/DTO + dedicated handler. Shipping only one is FAIL.

**Audit / Observability**

- [ ] Model uses `LogsActivity` with explicit `logOnly([...])`
- [ ] `logOnlyDirty()` + `dontSubmitEmptyLogs()` both present
- [ ] `AuditPort` is added only if the module has meaningful business actions beyond simple lifecycle logging
- [ ] No passwords, tokens, or sensitive fields are logged

**Security**

- [ ] No raw SQL with user input
- [ ] No `unserialize()` on external input
- [ ] `->whereUuid('uuid')` on UUID routes
- [ ] Permissions defined: `VIEW_X`, `CREATE_X`, `UPDATE_X`, `DELETE_X`, `RESTORE_X`
- [ ] `forgetCachedPermissions()` called before creating permissions

**Routes**

- [ ] Web routes are primary
- [ ] Data endpoints live under `/data/admin/*` when JSON CRUD is needed for the web app
- [ ] `POST /bulk-delete` AND `POST /bulk-restore` co-exist when the module exposes batch selection — guarded by `permission:DELETE_*` / `permission:RESTORE_*` respectively
- [ ] API routes are only added if explicitly requested

**Filters (`{Entity}FilterData` — see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5.2)**

- [ ] `{Entity}FilterData` carries `search`, `status`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `sort_field`, `sort_order`, `page`, `per_page`
- [ ] `#[BeforeOrEqual('date_to')]` / `#[AfterOrEqual('date_from')]` validation attributes present
- [ ] Single Eloquent `scopeApplyFilters({Entity}FilterData $f)` on the model — REUSED by `List{Entities}Handler`, `{Entity}ExcelExport`, `{Entity}PdfExport` (no duplicated `->when()` chains)
- [ ] Date range uses `whereBetween` with `CarbonImmutable::parse(...)->startOfDay()` / `->endOfDay()` for inclusive boundaries; single-bound (only `date_from` OR only `date_to`) supported via separate `when()` branches
- [ ] Composite DB index `[deleted_at, created_at]` (or `[status, created_at]`) added in the migration for the filter pattern

**Tests**

- [ ] Feature tests cover the HTTP CRUD flow
- [ ] `bulk delete` AND `bulk restore` both have feature coverage when the endpoints exist
- [ ] Unit tests exist for custom Value Objects or domain invariants when present
- [ ] Integration tests exist only when mapper logic or persistence rules are non-trivial

**Conditional Sections — only if explicitly requested**

- [ ] Exports — full rules in `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §8 (spatie/simple-excel streaming, DomPDF Blade in `resources/views/exports/pdf/`, `Status` derived from `deleted_at` as `Active`/`Suspended`, `/export` BEFORE `/{uuid}`)
- [ ] File storage / uploads (R2 only — see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5 Storage Strategy)
- [ ] API + OpenAPI annotations (Scramble — `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §9)
- [ ] Queue / events / listeners
- [ ] WebSockets / Reverb

---

## PHASE 2 — GENERATE

Generate only the minimal files required by the request.

Rules:

- Do not create `Storage`, `Queue`, `WebSocket`, `Export`, `ExternalServices`, `Api`, listeners, or events unless the request truly needs them.
- Do not create speculative abstractions for a 5-field CRUD.
- Prefer one clear flow over a “perfect” enterprise tree.
- Keep controllers thin and business rules out of controllers.
- Keep the domain model clean, but do not invent fake complexity.
- If `bulk delete` is requested, ship it WITH `bulk restore` (paired). One simple batch command over UUIDs each, not a separate sub-architecture.
- If PDF export is requested, create a dedicated CRUD Blade under `resources/views/exports/pdf/`.
- In soft-deletable CRUD PDF exports, derive `Status` only from `deleted_at` using `Active` / `Suspended` labels.
- Use context7 to confirm package APIs before writing framework-specific files.
- Use tavily when a security-sensitive or package-version-sensitive decision is involved.

## PHASE 3 — VERIFY

After generating files, re-run the Phase 1 checklist.

Expected result:

- ✅ All required items PASS
- 📊 Score: X/Y required items
- 📝 Conditional items clearly marked as DONE or SKIPPED with reason

If any required item fails, fix the minimum necessary code and verify again.

Then respond with EXACTLY 5 lines:

```text
✅ Simple CRUD {Name} generated — {N} files with minimal Domain / Application / Infrastructure.
🧱 Entity, repository port, mapper, handlers, controllers, requests, and routes are in place.
🔐 Permissions seeded: VIEW_{X}, CREATE_{X}, UPDATE_{X}, DELETE_{X}, RESTORE_{X}.
🧪 Tests: Feature CRUD {plus optional Unit/Integration if justified}.
📊 {score}/{total} required rules passed · Simple CRUD baseline preserved.
```
