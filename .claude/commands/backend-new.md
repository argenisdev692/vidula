## description: Generates a complete Laravel 13 / PHP 8.5 CRUD module from scratch against architecture, security, audit & test rules. Uses sequential thinking for hard reasoning. Responds with a 5-line summary only.

# BACKEND NEW MODULE AGENT — PHP 8.5 + Laravel 13

## PHASE 0 — QUALIFY THE REQUEST

Solo-dev DEFAULT is `/backend-new-crud` (simple baseline). Promote to this intermediate workflow ONLY when at least ONE of these is true (mirrors `rules.md` Solo-dev default):

1. Aggregate root with domain invariants beyond simple validation (state machines, multi-step lifecycle).
2. ≥ 2 third-party integrations live in the module (LLM provider + payment gateway, etc.).
3. Cross-module orchestration with domain events that already have ≥ 1 listener.
4. The module has > 15 persisted fields OR composes ≥ 2 sub-entities under one aggregate.
5. Excel/PDF exports AND queue workers AND WebSockets co-exist in the same module.

If NONE of the above is true, STOP and instruct the user to use `/backend-new-crud` instead.

## PHASE 1 — PLAN NEW CRUD OR MODULE (produce checklist)

Before writing any code, you MUST:

1. Read `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` and `.claude/skills/ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md` (intermediate baseline)
2. Read `.claude/OWASP/SKILL.md` — the always-on security baseline (15+1 items mapped to OWASP Top 10:**2025** + API Top 10:2023 + LLM Top 10:2025 when AI is in scope)
3. Call context7 to resolve current docs for: Laravel 13, Spatie Laravel Data 4.x, Spatie Permission 7.x, Spatie Activitylog, Pest 4
4. Call tavily to verify the latest stable versions of all packages, prioritizing recent/current sources (`time_range: day`, `week`, or `month`) and official docs; avoid historical years unless the task explicitly asks for them
5. USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING TO REASON HARD about the module structure, field types, ValueObject candidates, CQRS boundaries, audit fields, permission names, export shape, and test coverage — before generating a single file

Then generate the indicated module following these rules.
For each generated item mark ✅ DONE, ❌ SKIPPED (with reason) or ⚠️ WARN.

### Required Generation Checklist

**PHP 8.5 — applies to ALL layers including exports (see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5.1 + §8)**

- [ ] `declare(strict_types=1)` in EVERY .php file
- [ ] `final readonly class` on every stateless DI class (Handlers, VOs, Adapters, Controllers, ExcelExport, PdfExport)
- [ ] Pipe `|>` in sequential transformations — MANDATORY in `{Entity}ExportTransformer` chain (extract → formatDates → sanitize) and normalization chains in Handlers
- [ ] `clone($obj, [...])` in wither methods (no manual `get_object_vars()` boilerplate)
- [ ] `array_first()` / `array_last()` (never `reset()`/`end()`)
- [ ] `#[\NoDiscard]` on `transformForExcel()` + `transformForPdf()` statics, Command Handlers returning IDs, sanitization methods
- [ ] `Uri\Rfc3986\Uri` or `Uri\WhatWg\Url` (never `parse_url()`)
- [ ] `FILTER_THROW_ON_FAILURE` in `filter_var` validations inside Value Objects
- [ ] `match` expression over chained `if/elseif` (ExportController format branch, state transitions)
- [ ] Constructor property promotion on every class with injected dependencies
- [ ] `casts()` **method** (Laravel 11+) on every Eloquent model — NEVER the legacy `$casts` array
- [ ] PSR-12: explicit return type on EVERY method

**Architecture (`.claude/skills/ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md`)**

- [ ] Module lives in `src/Modules/{Name}/` with Domain / Application / Infrastructure
- [ ] Domain imports nothing from Infrastructure or Laravel
- [ ] Mapper is the ONLY contact point between Domain and Eloquent (Mapper Optionality Rule applies — `N/A` is valid when Eloquent casts cover translation)
- [ ] ValueObjects are `readonly` + validation via property hooks
- [ ] DTOs extend `Spatie\LaravelData\Data` and are NOT `readonly`
- [ ] Commands/Queries follow strict CQRS separation
- [ ] `BulkDelete{Entity}Handler` + `BulkRestore{Entity}Handler` ship together when UI exposes row selection (paired — shipping one without the other is FAIL)
- [ ] Repository: port defined in Domain, implementation in Infrastructure
- [ ] ServiceProvider registered in `bootstrap/providers.php`

**Audit / Observability (§11)**

- [ ] Model uses `LogsActivity` trait with explicit `logOnly([...])`
- [ ] `logOnlyDirty()` + `dontSubmitEmptyLogs()` both present
- [ ] `AuditPort` called manually in CommandHandlers for business actions
- [ ] NEVER `logAll()`, never log passwords/tokens/PII
- [ ] Structured logging via OTEL (never bare `Log::error('string')`)

**Security (§10)**

- [ ] No raw SQL with user input
- [ ] No `unserialize()` on external input
- [ ] `->whereUuid('uuid')` on UUID routes
- [ ] Permissions defined: `VIEW_X`, `CREATE_X`, `UPDATE_X`, `DELETE_X`, `RESTORE_X`
- [ ] `DELETE_X` guards both `delete` and `bulk-delete`; `RESTORE_X` guards both `restore` and `bulk-restore`
- [ ] `forgetCachedPermissions()` called BEFORE creating permissions

**Exports — see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §8 (single source of truth, do NOT duplicate rules here)**

- [ ] Export flow follows `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §8 exactly (`spatie/simple-excel` streaming, DomPDF + Blade, ExportTransformer with `|>` chain + `#[\NoDiscard]`, `Status` derived from `deleted_at` as `Active`/`Suspended`, `/export` route BEFORE `/{uuid}`, shared FilterDTO)
- [ ] Every export file (`ExcelExport`, `PdfExport`, `ExportTransformer`, `ExportController`) is `final readonly` with constructor property promotion and uses PHP 8.5 idioms — same standard as the rest of the module (§5.1)

**Filters — see `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5.2**

- [ ] `{Entity}FilterData` carries `search`, `status`, `date_from`, `date_to`, `sort_field`, `sort_order`, `page`, `per_page` with `#[BeforeOrEqual('date_to')]` / `#[AfterOrEqual('date_from')]` attributes
- [ ] Single Eloquent `scopeApplyFilters({Entity}FilterData $f)` used by `List{Entities}Handler`, `{Entity}ExcelExport`, `{Entity}PdfExport` — DRY by construction, no duplicated `->when()` chains
- [ ] Date range uses `whereBetween` with `CarbonImmutable::parse(...)->startOfDay()/endOfDay()`; supports single-bound (only `date_from` OR only `date_to`)
- [ ] Composite DB index `[deleted_at, created_at]` (or matching filter pattern) declared in the migration

**Tests (§7)**

- [ ] Unit/Domain — domain invariants
- [ ] Unit/Application — handlers with mocked repository
- [ ] Integration — DB round-trip via Mapper
- [ ] Feature — full HTTP CRUD + export

**OpenAPI (§9)**

- [ ] `dedoc/scramble` installed and configured in `AppServiceProvider`
- [ ] Every API controller method has an explicit return type-hint (`: JsonResponse`, `: BinaryFileResponse`, etc.)
- [ ] FormRequests injected for all write endpoints (Scramble reads `rules()`)
- [ ] Spatie Data used for response shapes (Scramble reads property types)

## PHASE 2 — GENERATE

For each item in the checklist: generate the file following the exact rules in `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` and the security baseline in `.claude/OWASP/SKILL.md`.
Use context7 to confirm the correct package API before writing each file.
Use tavily to verify current best practices or check for CVEs on any security-sensitive file.
USE SEQUENTIAL THINKING on every file that involves layer boundaries, audit fields, or permission logic.

---

## PHASE 3 — VERIFICATION

After all files are generated, re-run EVERY item from Phase 1. Expected result:

✅ ALL items PASS
📊 Score: X/Y items — target 100%

If any item remains ❌, repeat Phase 2 → Phase 3 until perfect score.
Then respond with EXACTLY 5 lines — no extra output, no file listing, no explanation:

```
✅ Module {Name} generated — {N} files across Domain / Application / Infrastructure.
📦 {DTO1}, {DTO2} · FilterDTO shared with Excel + PDF exports.
🔐 Permissions seeded: VIEW_{X}, CREATE_{X}, UPDATE_{X}, DELETE_{X}.
🧪 Tests: Unit/Domain, Unit/Application (mocked), Integration (DB), Feature (HTTP+export).
📊 {score}/{total} rules passed · Sequential thinking applied on {N} reasoning steps.
```
