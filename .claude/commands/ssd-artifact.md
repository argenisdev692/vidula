description: Applies Spec-Driven Development (SDD) to build backend modules, services, or APIs. ALWAYS use when the user describes a new backend module, asks to create an API, design a service, or invokes /ssd-artifact. Runs 7 phases in order — Specify, Clarify, Research (real-time via Tavily), Plan, Break Down Tasks, Analyze, Implement, Consolidate — without skipping any.

# SDD Backend: Specify → Clarify → Research (+Tavily) → Plan → Tasks → Analyze → Implement → Consolidate

This skill turns a backend module description into working software, following
Spec-Driven Development (SDD): the specification is the source of truth, the code is its
consequence. It follows the current (2026) GitHub Spec Kit flow
(`constitution → specify → clarify → plan → tasks → analyze → implement`), with one addition:
**before writing the technical plan, real-time research is done with Tavily** to verify
versions, architecture patterns, and current practices, instead of relying only on trained
knowledge that may be outdated.

Golden rule (confirmed against current SDD practice): never skip from spec straight to code.
Review the plan before breaking down tasks; review the tasks before implementing. Don't merge
phases. Each phase produces a Markdown file that the next phase consumes. If the user only asks
for "one part" (e.g. "just make me the plan"), still follow this same format for that phase, but
tell them which previous phases you assumed or which are missing.

**When SDD is the wrong tool:** small bug fixes, rapid prototyping, throwaway experiments, or
simple CRUD features are better served by direct prompting or this project's SIMPLE-CRUD skill —
running the full SDD workflow on those is disproportionate ceremony. Use this skill for
genuinely new modules/services/APIs with real design decisions to trace.

## When to activate
- The user describes a backend feature, module, service, or API they want to build.
- The user writes `/ssd-artifact {description}`.
- The user explicitly asks for "spec driven development", "SDD", "specify and plan this".

## Setup (once per feature)

1. Determine a short kebab-case slug from the description (e.g. "payment system with
   retries" → `payment-retry-service`).
2. Look for a `specs/` folder at the project root (create it if it doesn't exist). Number the
   feature by scanning existing folders: `specs/001-{slug}/`, `specs/002-{slug}/`, etc.
3. If `.specify/memory/constitution.md` or `CONSTITUTION.md` exists in the project, read it first:
   it contains non-negotiable principles (code style, mandatory testing, allowed stack) that
   must be respected across all phases. If it doesn't exist, don't require it — it's optional,
   not blocking.
4. Copy the templates from `.claude/skills/SSD/` (`spec_template.md`, `plan_template.md`,
   `tasks_template.md`) as the base for the files you'll generate in `specs/NNN-{slug}/`.

## Phase 1 — SPECIFY

**Goal:** capture WHAT is being built and WHY. No mentions of technical stack, libraries, or
database schemas here — that belongs in the Plan phase.

1. From the user's description, write `specs/NNN-{slug}/spec.md` using
   `.claude/skills/SSD/spec_template.md`: summary, motivation, actors, user stories with
   verifiable acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format), functional and non-functional
   requirements, conceptual data entities, out of scope, and success criteria.
2. If something is ambiguous, don't resolve it here — mark it as `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` or
   `Assumption:` in section 9 and move on. Ambiguity resolution is Phase 2's job, not Phase 1's.
3. Show the spec to the user and wait for confirmation (or "continue") before moving to Phase 2,
   unless the user already explicitly asked to "do it all at once".

## Phase 2 — CLARIFY

**Goal:** surface every ambiguity in the spec as an explicit, reviewable artifact before any
planning starts. Ambiguities that silently carry into the plan are the single biggest cause of
an AI agent building the wrong thing.

1. Re-read `spec.md` looking specifically for: underspecified requirements, conflicting user
   stories, missing edge cases, and every unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` / `Assumption:`
   marker left from Phase 1.
2. Write `specs/NNN-{slug}/clarify.md`: a numbered list of open questions, each stating the
   impact if left unresolved (e.g. "Q3: What happens on a duplicate submission? Impact: changes
   the idempotency design in Plan §4").
3. Ask the user the highest-impact 2-3 questions directly. For lower-impact ones, propose a
   reasonable default and record it as `Resolved by default:` in `clarify.md` instead of
   blocking on it.
4. Update `spec.md` in place with the resolved answers — replace `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers
   with the actual decision. `clarify.md` stays as the audit trail of what was asked, and why.
5. Don't move to Phase 3 while a high-impact question remains unresolved in `clarify.md`.

## Phase 3 — REAL-TIME RESEARCH (Tavily)

**Goal:** don't plan on stale assumptions. Before locking in stack, versions, architecture
patterns, auth schemes, or libraries, validate them against current, live sources.

1. From `spec.md`/`clarify.md` and any stack preference the user mentioned, build 3-6 specific
   research queries. Examples of what to research:
   - Current stable version and maturity of the proposed framework/library (e.g. "FastAPI vs
     Django REST framework 2026", "current Node.js LTS").
   - Recommended architecture patterns for this type of module (e.g. "event-driven order
     processing best practices", "idempotency key patterns REST API").
   - Security: current guidance (e.g. "OWASP API security top 10 2026", "JWT refresh token
     rotation best practices").
   - Recent breaking changes / deprecations in the chosen stack.
   - Infrastructure alternatives (queues, cache, DB) if the spec requires them.
2. Run the queries directly with the Tavily MCP tools available in this session — batch related
   queries in as few calls as possible instead of one call per query:
   - `mcp__tavily__tavily_search` for targeted lookups. Pass `time_range: "week"` or `"month"`
     to bias toward current results, and avoid historical years unless the task explicitly asks
     for them.
   - `mcp__tavily__tavily_research` for deeper, multi-step investigation on ambiguous or
     high-stakes decisions (e.g. choosing between two competing architecture patterns).
   - `mcp__tavily__tavily_extract` / `mcp__tavily__tavily_crawl` if you need the full content of
     a specific doc page returned by search rather than just the snippet.
3. Write the findings to `specs/NNN-{slug}/research.md`: one section per query, each finding
   cited with its source URL. Every relevant finding must translate into a row in the plan's
   "Technology stack" table (Phase 4).
4. If the Tavily MCP tools are unavailable in this session for any reason, fall back to the
   general web search tool and mark explicitly in `research.md` which findings were NOT
   verified via Tavily.
5. If research contradicts a spec assumption or a user preference (e.g. the user asked for an
   already-deprecated library), don't silently change it — report it as an open decision when
   moving to Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — PLAN

**Goal:** the HOW, with every technical decision traceable to `spec.md` (which requirement it
covers) or to `research.md` (why it was chosen).

1. Write `specs/NNN-{slug}/plan.md` using `.claude/skills/SSD/plan_template.md`: verified stack,
   architecture, physical data model, API contracts endpoint by endpoint (derived from the user
   stories), folder structure, testing strategy, security, risks, and the final traceability
   table.
2. Any technical choice NOT validated by `research.md` must be explicitly marked as
   `[UNVERIFIED]` in the stack table — never present it as if it were confirmed.
3. Show the plan and wait for confirmation before breaking down tasks, unless told otherwise.

## Phase 5 — BREAK DOWN TASKS

**Goal:** turn the plan into a list of small tasks, ordered by dependency, each independently
verifiable.

1. Write `specs/NNN-{slug}/tasks.md` using `.claude/skills/SSD/tasks_template.md`, grouping tasks
   by: foundations → data model → one phase per user story (in spec priority order) →
   cross-cutting concerns (auth, validation, logging, security) → closeout (full test suite,
   traceability, documentation).
2. Mark parallelizable tasks with `[P]` (tasks that don't touch the same files and don't depend
   on each other).
3. Each task must leave the system in a compiling/testable state, never half-broken.

## Phase 6 — ANALYZE

**Goal:** cross-check spec ↔ plan ↔ tasks for consistency before writing any implementation
code — catch drift while it's still cheap to fix, not after the code is already written.

1. Verify every functional requirement and user story in `spec.md` maps to at least one section
   in `plan.md` (via its traceability table) and at least one task in `tasks.md`.
2. Verify every task in `tasks.md` traces back to a plan section and, transitively, to a spec
   requirement. Flag orphan tasks (no spec justification) and orphan requirements (no task
   covers them).
3. Verify no decision in `plan.md` contradicts an answer already resolved in `clarify.md`.
4. Write the findings to `specs/NNN-{slug}/analyze.md`: a short table of gaps/contradictions
   found, or "No gaps found" if the cross-check is clean.
5. If gaps are found, fix `tasks.md` (add or adjust tasks) before moving to Phase 7 — never
   implement against a plan known to have unresolved gaps.

## Phase 7 — IMPLEMENT

**Goal:** execute `tasks.md` in order, producing real code and real tests.

1. Take the tasks in order (respecting dependencies; `[P]` tasks can be grouped).
2. For each task: implement the change, run the relevant tests/linters, check the box in
   `tasks.md` as `[x]`, and if the project uses git, suggest or create a commit following the
   `feat(module): T0XX short description` convention.
3. Once all tasks are done, do a final pass comparing the implementation against `spec.md`:
   confirm every functional requirement and user story has code and a test covering it (use the
   traceability table from `plan.md` as a checklist). Report any gap as a new task in `tasks.md`
   instead of assuming it's covered.

## Phase 8 — CONSOLIDATE

**Goal:** once every phase is complete, produce a single standalone document covering the full
SDD journey for this module — the deliverable to hand off or archive.

1. Write `specs/NNN-{slug}/SSD-SUMMARY.md` combining, phase by phase:
   - **Specify** — the final spec: summary, actors, user stories, requirements.
   - **Clarify** — the key open questions raised and how each was resolved.
   - **Research** — key findings and their sources from `research.md`.
   - **Plan** — the final architecture, stack table, and API contracts from `plan.md`.
   - **Tasks** — the completed task list from `tasks.md`, with checkboxes reflecting real status.
   - **Analyze** — the consistency check result from `analyze.md`.
   - **Implement** — an implementation report: what was built, which tests cover which
     requirement, and any gaps flagged during the final traceability pass.
2. Each section must link back to its source file (`spec.md`, `clarify.md`, `research.md`,
   `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `analyze.md`) so the reader can go deeper, but the summary itself must
   stand alone without requiring the reader to open the other files.
3. Show the path to `SSD-SUMMARY.md` to the user as the closing deliverable of the workflow.

## Resources of this skill
- `.claude/skills/SSD/spec_template.md` — Phase 1 template.
- `.claude/skills/SSD/plan_template.md` — Phase 4 template.
- `.claude/skills/SSD/tasks_template.md` — Phase 5 template.
- Tavily MCP tools (`mcp__tavily__tavily_search`, `tavily_research`, `tavily_extract`,
  `tavily_map`, `tavily_crawl`) — real-time research for Phase 3, used directly, no external
  script or API key setup needed.

## Hard rules
- Don't write `plan.md` before resolving high-impact questions in `clarify.md` and running
  Tavily research in Phase 3 (or, failing that, without explicitly stating why research wasn't
  possible and what's left unverified).
- Don't mix the "what" (spec) with the "how" (plan): if you find yourself writing library names
  in `spec.md`, move it to `plan.md`.
- Don't move from Phase 6 (Analyze) to Phase 7 (Implement) while `analyze.md` lists unresolved
  gaps or contradictions.
- Don't mark a task as complete in `tasks.md` without having run its corresponding test.
- Don't produce `SSD-SUMMARY.md` (Phase 8) until every task in `tasks.md` is checked off or its
  gaps are explicitly logged.
- If the user requests changes mid-implementation, update `spec.md` (or `plan.md`, as
  appropriate) first, then propagate the change to `tasks.md` — never edit only the code while
  leaving the documentation stale.
