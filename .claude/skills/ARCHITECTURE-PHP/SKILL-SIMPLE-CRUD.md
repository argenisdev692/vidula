# ARCHITECTURE-PHP / SKILL-SIMPLE-CRUD — Standard CRUD Baseline

Use this guide when the module is a normal CRUD:

- One aggregate / one main entity.
- Around 3 to 8 persisted fields.
- Standard flows: list, show, create, update, delete, restore.
- Standard flows may also include `bulk delete` AND `bulk restore` when the table UI supports row selection. They are always paired — never ship bulk delete without bulk restore.
- No files/media, exports, queues, WebSockets, external integrations, projections, or complex orchestration unless explicitly requested.
- Business rules are real but shallow: uniqueness, active/inactive, ordering, visibility, simple validation.

Do NOT use this guide when the module has any of these characteristics:

- More than one aggregate root or several coordinated subdomains.
- Heavy business workflows, approvals, multi-step state machines, or cross-module orchestration.
- Files, signatures, image processing, cloud storage, exports, notifications, or external APIs.
- Domain events, listeners, projections, read repositories, or async processing are clearly justified.
- Rich Value Objects and advanced invariants dominate the model.

In those cases, use `.claude/skills/ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md` (the intermediate baseline).

---

## Composer Autoload (PSR-4)

Simple CRUD modules live under the same PSR-4 root as the intermediate tree:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "App\\":      "app/",
      "Modules\\":  "src/Modules/",
      "Shared\\":   "src/Shared/",
      "Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/",
      "Database\\Seeders\\":   "database/seeders/"
    }
  }
}
```

After scaffolding a new module, ALWAYS run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer dump-autoload
```

Example namespace mapping for a simple CRUD module:

| Path | Namespace |
|---|---|
| `src/Modules/Tags/Domain/ValueObjects/TagId.php` | `Modules\Tags\Domain\ValueObjects\TagId` |
| `src/Modules/Tags/Application/Commands/CreateTagHandler.php` | `Modules\Tags\Application\Commands\CreateTagHandler` |
| `src/Modules/Tags/Application/Queries/ListTagsHandler.php` | `Modules\Tags\Application\Queries\ListTagsHandler` |
| `src/Modules/Tags/Infrastructure/Http/Controllers/TagController.php` | `Modules\Tags\Infrastructure\Http\Controllers\TagController` |
| `src/Modules/Tags/Infrastructure/Persistence/Eloquent/Models/TagEloquentModel.php` | `Modules\Tags\Infrastructure\Persistence\Eloquent\Models\TagEloquentModel` |
| `src/Modules/Tags/Providers/TagsServiceProvider.php` | `Modules\Tags\Providers\TagsServiceProvider` |

> **Hard rule:** Simple CRUD modules use the same flat namespaces (`Modules\`, `Shared\`) as the full hexagonal tree. No `Src\` prefix, no per-module top-level namespace. This keeps both architectures interoperable when a module grows from simple → full.

Register the module provider in `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    Shared\Providers\SharedServiceProvider::class,
    Modules\Tags\Providers\TagsServiceProvider::class,
    // …one per module
];
```

## Mandatory Baseline

- Keep `Domain / Application / Infrastructure` separation.
- Keep `Application/Commands` and `Application/Queries` flat. Do not create one extra folder per handler unless the module grows.
- The domain stays free of Laravel, HTTP, Eloquent, queues, storage, and framework imports.
- The repository port lives in `Domain/Ports`; the concrete Eloquent repository lives in `Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories`.
- The mapper is the only bridge between Domain entities and Eloquent models WHEN it exists. Mapper is optional in simple CRUD — see Mapper Optionality Rule.
- Controllers stay thin: validate, authorize, map request to DTO, invoke handler, return response.
- DTOs extend `Spatie\LaravelData\Data` and are **not** `readonly` (parent class `Spatie\LaravelData\Data` is not readonly → PHP forbids a readonly child of a non-readonly parent). See `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §5 Readonly Classes table.
- Public routes use `uuid`, not numeric `id`.
- Web routes are primary. API routes are optional and secondary.
- The module `ServiceProvider` is responsible for binding `{YourEntity}RepositoryPort::class` to `Eloquent{YourEntity}Repository::class`, loading routes, and loading views when export templates exist.
- If `bulk delete` is part of the UI scope, implement it as one dedicated command handler plus one request/DTO carrying the selected UUIDs.

---

## What Stays Small on Purpose

- One repository port for the aggregate is enough.
- One Eloquent repository is enough.
- One resource class is enough unless list/detail representations truly diverge.
- One resourceful controller is enough for most modules. Splitting into Web/Api controllers is allowed only when the two flows truly diverge — see Controller Fusion Rule.
- One service provider that binds the repository and loads routes is enough.
- One export controller plus one Excel export and one PDF export are enough when the module explicitly requires exports.
- One dedicated `Export{YourEntity}Request` is enough to validate export query params when the module exposes export endpoints.
- One `bulk delete` handler + one `bulk restore` handler are enough when mass selection exists in the UI — they are paired, never one without the other.
- Keep the folder depth low so the create/list/update flow is traceable in under a minute.

---

## Entity Optionality Rule

- `Domain/Entities/{YourEntity}.php` is OPTIONAL in simple CRUD.
- SKIP the Domain Entity when ALL of the following are true:
  - The Eloquent model is 1:1 with the aggregate (same fields, no transformation).
  - No domain invariants live outside Value Objects.
  - No method exists on the entity beyond getters / passive data access.
- CREATE the Domain Entity when ANY is true:
  - Domain methods enforce invariants (`activate()`, `markAsPaid()`, `transitionTo($state)`).
  - The aggregate composes multiple sub-entities or VOs with cross-field rules.
  - Persistence and domain shapes diverge (Mapper required → Entity required).
- When skipped, controllers/handlers operate on the Eloquent model + VOs + DTOs (`{YourEntity}Data::from($model)`).
- Auditors must NOT flag the absence of `Domain/Entities/` as FAIL when the criteria above are not met.

> Mirrors the same rule in `ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md` (Lean Mode) so a module promoted from simple → full does not gain a mandatory Entity it never had.

---

## Mapper Optionality Rule

- The Mapper is OPTIONAL in simple CRUD.
- Default path: use Eloquent casts (`casts` array, custom `CastsAttributes`, accessors, mutators) and let the Eloquent model carry persistence ↔ field translation.
- Create a Mapper class ONLY when one of these is true:
  - The persisted table shape diverges from the domain aggregate (different column names, denormalization, splitting fields).
  - A Value Object has a non-trivial mapping that does not fit a simple cast.
  - The repository must produce a domain entity distinct from the Eloquent model.
- When the Mapper is omitted, the Eloquent model itself is the persistence boundary; controllers/handlers receive the Eloquent model OR DTOs hydrated from it via `{YourEntity}Data::from($model)`.
- Auditors must NOT flag the absence of a Mapper as FAIL when the criteria above are not met.

---

## Controller Fusion Rule

- Default: ONE resourceful controller `Infrastructure/Http/Controllers/{YourEntity}Controller.php` serves both Inertia (web) and JSON (api), branching on `$request->expectsJson()` or middleware group.
- Split into `Api/{YourEntity}Controller.php` + `Web/{YourEntity}PageController.php` ONLY when:
  - The Inertia page needs additional props (selects, related entities) that the API never sends.
  - The API response shape differs significantly from the Inertia props.
  - The two flows have different authorization or rate-limiting needs.
- When fused, API methods MUST carry explicit return type-hints — Scramble auto-documents them.
- Auditors must NOT flag controller fusion as FAIL when these criteria are met.

---

## DTO Fusion Rule

- Default: separate `Store{YourEntity}Data` and `Update{YourEntity}Data`.
- Allowed: a single `{YourEntity}Data` with optional fields when Store and Update share ≥90% of fields and validation rules. Use `Optional` from `Spatie\LaravelData` for fields that only apply to one operation.
- Always keep `{YourEntity}FilterData` and `BulkDelete{YourEntity}Data` separate — they have a different purpose.
- Auditors must NOT flag DTO fusion as FAIL when the ≥90% criterion is met.

---

## Value Objects Rule

- `Uuid` or `{YourEntity}Id` is mandatory.
- Add more Value Objects only when a field has a real invariant worth protecting for the whole lifetime of the object.
- Good candidates: email, slug, money, percentage, status, normalized phone, URL.
- Do not wrap every string or every primitive only to satisfy architecture aesthetics.

---

## CQRS Rule for Simple CRUD

- Keep write handlers in `Application/Commands/`.
- Keep read handlers in `Application/Queries/`.
- This is still CQRS, but **basic CQRS** — controllers invoke handlers directly via container resolution:

  ```php
  public function store(StoreTagData $data, CreateTagHandler $handler): RedirectResponse
  {
      $handler->handle($data);
      return back();
  }
  ```

- `bulk delete` belongs to Commands, never Queries.
- Do NOT introduce `CommandBus` / `QueryBus`, projections, read repositories, listeners, or denormalized views unless a real second use-case requires them.
- **Upgrade trigger:** when the module accumulates ≥3 commands AND you need cross-cutting middleware (transaction, audit, logging), promote the module to the full hexagonal tree (`ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md`) and adopt the bus there.

---

## Events & Listeners in Simple CRUD

- **Default:** none. A simple CRUD does NOT emit domain events.
- **Allowed:** add ONE event per module **only** when a side-effect crosses bounded contexts AND cannot be inlined in the handler. Examples that justify it:
  - `TagCreated` → another module needs to react (e.g., search index re-build).
  - `TagRestored` → audit module logs a cross-cutting trail.
- **Not justified:**
  - "Send welcome email after create" → call the mailer directly from the handler.
  - "Update related counter" → use a model observer or update in the handler.
- When added:
  - Event lives at `Domain/Events/{EntityVerb}.php` (immutable readonly).
  - Listener lives in the **consuming** module under `Application/Listeners/`, never in the emitting module.
  - Use `#[AsEventListener]` (Laravel 13) — no manual `EventServiceProvider::$listen` array.
  - Long-running listeners implement `ShouldQueue`.

> Full Event/Listener mechanics, queue handling, and cross-module ACL examples → see `ARCHITECTURE-PHP/SKILL.md` (the intermediate baseline).

---

## Optional Folders — Add Only If Needed

Add these only when the module genuinely requires them:

- `Infrastructure/Storage/`
- `Infrastructure/Queue/`
- `Infrastructure/WebSocket/`
- `Infrastructure/ExternalServices/`
- `Application/Policies/`
- `Application/Listeners/`
- `Domain/Events/`
- extra `Tests/Integration/`

If you add one of these folders, be able to explain the concrete use-case in one sentence.

> `Infrastructure/Http/Export/` and `resources/views/exports/pdf/` are NOT optional when exports are in scope — see **Export Rule** below.

---

## ServiceProvider Rule

- `{YourModule}ServiceProvider` is mandatory even in a simple CRUD.
- It must bind the repository interface/port to the concrete repository implementation.
- It must register module routes.
- If the module includes PDF export views, it should also register the module view namespace.
- Keep the provider small: bindings, route loading, and optional view loading only.

Canonical responsibility set:

- `bind({YourEntity}RepositoryPort::class, Eloquent{YourEntity}Repository::class)`
- load `Infrastructure/Routes/web.php`
- load export Blade views only if the module ships PDF exports

---

## Export Rule — Mandatory When Exports Are in Scope

> **Single source of truth: `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §8.** Excel (`spatie/simple-excel`) + DomPDF + Transformer + Controller + Request + Blade template rules + status `Active`/`Suspended` derivation from `deleted_at` all live there. This file does NOT duplicate them — it only restates the file placement so the simple-CRUD tree stays self-contained.

### File placement (simple CRUD)

- `Infrastructure/Http/Export/{YourEntity}ExcelExport.php`
- `Infrastructure/Http/Export/{YourEntity}PdfExport.php`
- `Infrastructure/Http/Export/{YourEntity}ExportTransformer.php`
- `Infrastructure/Http/Controllers/Api/{YourEntity}ExportController.php`
- `Infrastructure/Http/Requests/Export{YourEntity}Request.php`
- `resources/views/exports/pdf/{your_module_snake}.blade.php` (global views, not per-module)

### Tests

- Feature test for Excel export: 200 + `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`.
- Feature test for PDF export: 200 + `application/pdf`.

---

## Bulk Delete + Bulk Restore Rule for Simple CRUD

> **Pair rule (mandatory)**: `bulk delete` and `bulk restore` are always shipped TOGETHER. Shipping bulk delete without bulk restore creates a UX dead-end — users can soft-delete dozens of rows in one click but must restore them one by one. Auditors must flag any module that ships only one of the two.

- Both are optional in simple CRUD, but become mandatory **as a pair** when the table supports row selection.
- Reuse the same aggregate repository; do not create a second repository for mass operations.
- **Bulk delete**:
  - Request/DTO: `BulkDelete{YourEntity}Request` + `BulkDelete{YourEntity}Data` (single field `uuids: array<string>`).
  - Handler: `BulkDelete{YourEntity}Handler` — performs soft delete (`whereIn('uuid', $uuids)->delete()`).
  - Route: `POST /bulk-delete` under the admin data group, guarded by `permission:DELETE_{X}`.
- **Bulk restore**:
  - Request/DTO: `BulkRestore{YourEntity}Request` + `BulkRestore{YourEntity}Data` (single field `uuids: array<string>`).
  - Handler: `BulkRestore{YourEntity}Handler` — performs soft restore (`withTrashed()->whereIn('uuid', $uuids)->restore()`).
  - Route: `POST /bulk-restore` under the admin data group, guarded by `permission:RESTORE_{X}`.
- Validate that the UUID array is non-empty, capped (e.g. `max:500` per request), and that every item is a valid UUID.
- Apply the same authorization rules as the single-row counterpart (`DELETE_{X}` / `RESTORE_{X}`).
- Frontend must disable bulk-restore when the selection mixes `active + deleted` rows (only deleted rows are restorable).
- If the UI has no row selection or no batch action, skip both completely.

---

## Identifiers & Relations — Project Conventions

### UUIDv7 (time-ordered) — MANDATORY for every `uuid`

- Every public identifier uses **UUID version 7**, never v4 — v7 is time-ordered, so sequential inserts stay index-local on the `uuid` column (much less B-tree fragmentation than random v4).
- Generate with `Str::uuid7()` (Laravel) or `Ramsey\Uuid\Uuid::uuid7()->toString()`. NEVER `Str::uuid()`, `Str::orderedUuid()`, or `Uuid::uuid4()`. Keep seeded, factory, and app-created rows uniform:
  - Model `creating` hook: `$model->uuid = (string) Str::uuid7();`
  - Factory: `'uuid' => (string) Str::uuid7()`
  - Seeder: `'uuid' => Uuid::uuid7()->toString()`
- **Trait-based models:** the framework `HasUuids` trait already returns `Str::uuid7()` in Laravel 13, so plain `use HasUuids;` is correct. NEVER use `HasVersion4Uuids` (legacy v4). Use a manual `creating` hook only when the `uuid` is a plain string column, not the model key.
- Routes still bind with `->whereUuid('uuid')` — it accepts any RFC-4122 UUID, v7 included.

### Bidirectional Eloquent relations — MANDATORY when an FK exists

When a model carries a foreign key (e.g. `user_id`), declare BOTH sides — never only the `belongsTo`:

- Child (owns the FK) → `belongsTo`, generic PHPDoc:
  ```php
  /** @return BelongsTo<User, $this> */
  public function user(): BelongsTo
  {
      return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
  }
  ```
- Parent (`User` / owning aggregate) → inverse `hasMany` / `hasOne`, generic PHPDoc:
  ```php
  /** @return HasMany<{YourEntity}EloquentModel, $this> */
  public function {yourEntities}(): HasMany
  {
      return $this->hasMany({YourEntity}EloquentModel::class);
  }
  ```
- Each model documents itself with the standard generated block ending in `@mixin \Eloquent` (regenerate via `./vendor/bin/sail artisan ide-helper:models`), otherwise linters report **"undefined type 'Eloquent'"** (`\Eloquent` lives in the git-ignored `_ide_helper.php`).
- **Auditors:** a one-directional FK relation (child `belongsTo` present, parent inverse missing) is a **FAIL**.

---

## Audit, Security, and Tests

- Use `LogsActivity` on the Eloquent model with explicit `logOnly([...])`, `logOnlyDirty()`, and `dontSubmitEmptyLogs()`.
- Use `AuditPort` only when there is a meaningful business action beyond passive model lifecycle logging.
- Define permissions with `VIEW_*`, `CREATE_*`, `UPDATE_*`, `DELETE_*`, `RESTORE_*`.
- Call `forgetCachedPermissions()` before seeding permissions.
- Mandatory tests for simple CRUD:
  - Feature tests for HTTP CRUD flow — these alone are sufficient for plain CRUDs.
  - Add feature coverage for `bulk delete` when the module exposes that endpoint.
  - Unit tests are OPTIONAL — create them only when there are custom Value Objects with invariants or non-trivial domain rules.
  - Integration tests are OPTIONAL — create them only when mapper logic, casts, scopes, or persistence rules are non-trivial.
  - If exports exist, add feature coverage for Excel/PDF export flow, validate the `Export{YourEntity}Request` contract, and keep the same `FilterDTO` contract.
- Auditors must NOT flag the absence of `Tests/Unit/` as FAIL when no VOs or domain invariants exist.

---

## KISS Guardrails

Avoid these by default in a 5-field CRUD:

- Generic `BaseRepository` inside the module.
- `Manager`, `Orchestrator`, `Coordinator`, or `Facade` classes with no second use-case.
- Domain events for direct one-step CRUD flows.
- Separate read/write repositories when the same aggregate query logic remains simple.
- WebSocket, queue, export, or storage abstractions without an actual requirement.
- Splitting Excel and PDF into multiple extra services when one export controller and one shared filter contract are enough.
- Creating a separate “mass operations” sub-architecture when a single `BulkDelete` command is enough.
- Deep folder nesting that makes maintenance slower than the business problem itself.

---

## Review Heuristic

If a reviewer cannot identify all of these quickly, the module is too complex for a normal CRUD:

- where the request enters,
- where validation happens,
- where the use-case handler lives,
- where the repository is bound,
- where the mapper converts domain ↔ persistence,
- where the `ServiceProvider` binds the port to the repository,
- and, if applicable, where export entry points, `Export{YourEntity}Request`, and Blade PDF views are registered,
- and where the routes are registered.

For language, PHP 8.5 syntax, route conventions, security rules, exports, and observability rules, always defer to `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` and the security baseline in `.claude/OWASP/SKILL.md`.

---

## OpenAPI / Scramble + API Routes

Cross-cutting rules — defined ONCE in `BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md`, NOT duplicated here (DRY):

- **Scramble auto-generation** (return type-hints, FormRequest injection, Spatie Data responses, zero `@OA\*` annotations) → `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §9.
- **API routes convention** (file location, ServiceProvider `registerWebRoutes()` / `registerApiRoutes()`, route order, permission middleware) → `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §6.
- **Excel + PDF exports** (`spatie/simple-excel` writer + DomPDF) → `.claude/BACKEND-PHP/SKILL.md` §8.

Simple CRUDs follow the same conventions as the full hexagonal tree — no special-cases.
